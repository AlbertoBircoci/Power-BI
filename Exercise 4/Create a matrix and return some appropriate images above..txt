Exercise: Create a Matrix to Compare Film Counts by Genre and Certificate

Objective:
Build a matrix visual to show how many films exist for each combination of genre and certificate.
Ensure the data counts are accurate and meaningful.
Display totals for both rows and columns.

Steps Taken:
Used the Matrix visual in Power BI.
Added Genre to Rows and Certificate to Columns.
Replaced Count of Genre with Count of FilmID to reflect the actual number of films.
Enabled row and column totals via the Format pane under "Subtotals" and "Grand totals".
Adjusted formatting to improve readability (e.g., font size, style, alternating row colors).
