📁 Project Summary: Natural Resources Dashboard in Power BI

This project presents a multi-page interactive Power BI dashboard built on historical data of 11 major natural resources, using both price and volume indicators. The data was collected through a Python script and visualized in Power BI to explore trends, volatility, correlation, and anomalies.

🧪 Data Collection

🔹 Source: Yahoo Finance (via yfinance Python library)
A custom Python script was developed to fetch historical daily close prices and trading volumes for the following 11 futures-based commodities:
Crude Oil WTI, Crude Oil Brent, Gold, Silver, Natural Gas, Corn, Wheat, Soybean, Copper, Platinum, Palladium

🔹 Output:
The script fetched each asset's full available history and stored the Close and Volume columns in a consolidated .csv file.
Each column was renamed to clearly indicate the resource and value type (e.g., CL=F_Close, GC=F_Volume).
Additionally, dates were standardized to the format dd/mm/yyyy, and the CSV was cleaned to ensure numeric formatting.

📊 Page 1 – Global Overview KPIs
Purpose: Quick glance at current conditions and short-term evolution.
🔹 Visual Elements:
11 KPI cards showing current average price per resource
11 conditional-format cards showing % deviation from monthly or yearly average (green up arrow for increase, red down arrow for decrease)

🔹 Interactivity:
A textual block explains the unit scale (e.g., Soybean shown in thousands, Copper in USD/lb)

📈 Page 2 – Time Trends (Price & Volume)
Purpose: Explore the evolution of each resource over time.
🔹 Visual Elements:
Two line charts (stacked): Price over time and Volume over time
Overlayed 365-day moving average line for both charts

🔹 Interactivity:
Dropdown slicer to switch between commodities
The graph updates automatically to display only the selected resource’s trend
Time axis adjusted to show full range without scrolling

🔄 Page 3 – Volatility & Correlation
Purpose: Understand relative variability and how resources behave together.
🔹 Volatility:
Bar chart of standard deviation for each resource (calculated from daily returns)

🔹 Correlation:
Color-encoded heatmap of correlation matrix between daily prices
Value labels omitted for clarity, color saturation guides interpretation

🔹 Interactivity:
Single resource slicer filters both visuals to emphasize relationships of a selected asset

⚠️ Page 4 – Anomalies & Price Spikes
This page highlights extreme price behavior for each resource over time.
The blue line shows the daily price.
The dotted black line is the 365-day moving average.
The gray area represents the expected range (±1 standard deviation).

🔹 Top 5 Tables:
One table showing top 5 highest daily closing prices and the dates
One table showing top 5 lowest closing prices and the dates
🔹 Additional features:
Constant lines and marker colors highlight extreme outlier behavior
Explanation box below details what qualifies as an anomaly

💾 Notes:
All visuals are dynamically linked and refresh automatically when the CSV is updated with new dates.
The dashboard is cleanly divided, labeled, and optimized for both presentation and interactive exploration.

🔍 Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard effectively transforms raw commodity price data into actionable insight, enabling users to:

Monitor market dynamics across energy, metals, and agriculture
Detect shifts and anomalies
Understand macro-trends, risks, and co-movements
The project blends financial data science with user-centered visualization to support real-world decision making or academic analysis.
